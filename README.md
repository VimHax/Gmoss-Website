# G-Moss Website

This repository contains the source code of a website I created for a competition, a live demo of which can be seen at https://gmoss.live or https://gmoss.vimprojects.com. The website is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). For more information about the competition and G-Moss itself you may visit one of the above 2 links or clone this repository and give it a read!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Build Instructions

You need to have [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed to follow along.
1. First you need to clone this repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vimhax/gmoss-website
   ```

2. Afterwards navigate into the directory and run the following command to install all the dependencies.
   ```sh
   npm install # you may need to add --force for this to work as the code is a bit outdated
   ```

3. Build it by running the following command.
   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```
   If you prefer a live preview you may run the following command instead.
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

Note the project video in the website will not work as the video file is not included in this repository, the file can be downloaded from https://gmoss.live/proposal.mp4 or https://gmoss.vimprojects.com/proposal.mp4.
