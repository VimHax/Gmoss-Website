						We have come a long way from our ancestors. We transformed from a
						primitive species to the dominant species of our planet in a blink
						of an eye while other species haven't even come close to making such
						a large leap in technology. We have advanced our understanding of
						the universe down to the small details over many years and, with
						this new found knowledge, developed technologies, such as cars,
						planes, computers etc, to improve living standards and help us focus
						more on the important aspects of life while giving us increasing
						control over our environment. However, with all these advances rose
						a colossal issue, <b>pollution</b>.

						<b>
							Disposal of waste has been a problem since the very beginning.
						</b>{' '}
						The worst part is that we still lack a proper solution! (Piling
						massive amounts of waste is definitely not a good long-term
						solution) Because of the rapidly increasing population waste
						disposal is becoming an even bigger problem. Out of the many
						problems pollution causes <b>the biggest is global warming</b>.

						because of the pollution we are creating and this is what we refer

						The above graph plots the observed temperatures with the

					<h1 className="SubTopic">Why haven't we stopped Global Warming?</h1>
					<p>
						Global warming feels like a problem which everybody and nobody knows
						about at the same time. Awareness about global warming is unlikely
						to be the problem at hand (there have been many articles, campaigns,
						news etc. about it) it's just that some of us don't want to take
						responsibility. Many campaigns have risen over the years and yet
						none of them managed to make any major changes to the status quo. We
						blame large companies and yet excuse our own behavior claiming that
						we can't make any significant difference. Undoubtedly even the
						smallest changes you make to help our country, our world, will make
						a dent if enough of us follow through with them. Even if that wasn't
						the case, history has shown us time and time again individuals which
						have revolutionized the world. For example, below is a video of a
						young girl, Greta Thunberg, who took matters into her own hands to
						help save the world.

						The Global Warming situation in Sri Lanka

						<p>Yearly Carbon Emissions Of Sri Lanka</p>
					</a>
					<p>
						In 2019, Sri Lankaâ€™s carbon dioxide emissions were as high as{' '}
						<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/co2/country/sri-lanka?country=~LKA#what-are-the-country-s-annual-co2-emissions">
							25 million tonnes
						</a>
						.{' '}
						<b>
							Year after year the carbon emissions have kept increasing, showing
							no signs of slowing down.
						</b>{' '}
						Moreover, Sri Lanka has an AQI (Air Quality Index) below 100. (In
						comparison the world's most polluted cities are standing at{' '}
						<a href="https://www.iqair.com/world-air-quality">about 200 AQI</a>){' '}
						This is a lot less than 200 AQI but, if we don't take any action to
						reduce our carbon footprint, the AQI will inevitably reach 200 due
						to the increasing number of vehicles and factories.

					<p>
						Most vehicles in Sri Lanka, as of 2016, have catalytic converters
						installed in them but sadly this unit actually does not help reduce
						carbon dioxide emissions. However Sri Lanka, being a third world
						country, majority of the vehicles being used are quite old so this
						makes the situation even worse as more carbon dioxide will be given
						out than normal. (Older vehicles aren't as optimized as vehicles
						nowadays for carbon dioxide emissions) The resultant excess waste
						gasses, which have been produced, increases air pollution
						drastically. Why is air pollution such a important thing to be
						considered? Due to the fact that it gives rise to diseases such as
						cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory diseases such as
						asthma.
